        <p> My favorite things to do are reading, drawing, playing, and creating. As soon as I come back from school, I literally DIVE into one of my books and bury my whole head in it and I read until my dad calls me for lunch. I also can create, even though I sometimes end up in trouble those times. But, most of the times I just create, create, create. I always like to play, as everyone does, but I like to play by myself sometimes, no people, just... me.</p>
